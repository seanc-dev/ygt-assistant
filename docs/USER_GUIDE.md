> schedule meeting for tomorrow please  # â†’ schedules meeting

```

#### **Ambiguous References**

```
> schedule team meeting tomorrow
> move it to 3pm                    # â†’ knows "it" refers to the team meeting
```

```
> schedule team meeting tomorrow at 10am
âœ… Event created successfully

> move it to 2pm
âœ… Event moved successfully

### **Smart Suggestions**
