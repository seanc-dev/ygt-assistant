# Narrative Memory Layer Test Plan

## Overview

Implement a narrative memory layer that builds and maintains high-level story arcs and user behavior patterns, supplementing raw embeddings with structured summaries of key life themes.

## Test Sections

### 1. Core Data Structures

- **Theme Entry Creation**: Test creating theme entries with topic, summary, last_updated, source_refs
- **Dynamic Pattern Creation**: Test creating dynamic patterns with pattern, datetime, recurrence, last_seen
- **Data Validation**: Test validation of required fields and data types
- **Serialization**: Test JSON serialization/deserialization of narrative entries

### 2. Narrative Memory Manager

- **Initialization**: Test NarrativeMemory class initialization and storage setup
- **Theme Management**: Test adding, updating, retrieving, and deleting theme entries
- **Pattern Management**: Test adding, updating, retrieving, and deleting dynamic patterns
- **Storage Persistence**: Test saving and loading narrative data from storage
- **Search and Retrieval**: Test finding themes and patterns by various criteria

### 3. Theme Analysis and Summarization

- **Theme Extraction**: Test extracting themes from past events and conversations
- **Summary Generation**: Test generating meaningful summaries from raw data
- **Cross-Reference Tracking**: Test tracking source references for themes
- **Theme Evolution**: Test updating themes as new data becomes available

### 4. Pattern Recognition

- **Temporal Pattern Detection**: Test identifying recurring time-based patterns
- **Behavioral Pattern Detection**: Test identifying recurring behavioral patterns
- **Contextual Pattern Detection**: Test identifying patterns in specific contexts
- **Pattern Confidence**: Test calculating confidence scores for detected patterns

### 5. Integration with Core Memory

- **Memory Integration**: Test how narrative memory integrates with existing CoreMemory
- **Trigger Mechanisms**: Test checkpoint actions that trigger narrative updates
- **Data Flow**: Test how data flows from CoreMemory to NarrativeMemory
- **Performance**: Test that narrative layer doesn't significantly impact performance

### 6. Query and Retrieval

- **Theme Queries**: Test querying themes by topic, content, or context
- **Pattern Queries**: Test querying patterns by type, frequency, or context
- **Combined Queries**: Test queries that combine themes and patterns
- **Relevance Scoring**: Test scoring relevance of narrative entries to queries

### 7. Update Strategy

- **Checkpoint Triggers**: Test triggering updates on specific actions
- **Batch Processing**: Test scheduled batch updates
- **Incremental Updates**: Test updating only changed or new data
- **Conflict Resolution**: Test handling conflicting narrative information

### 8. Performance and Scalability

- **Memory Usage**: Test memory usage with large datasets
- **Query Performance**: Test query performance with many narrative entries
- **Storage Efficiency**: Test storage efficiency of narrative data
- **Caching**: Test caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data

## Implementation Order

1. Core data structures (ThemeEntry, DynamicPattern)
2. Basic NarrativeMemory manager
3. Storage and persistence
4. Theme analysis and summarization
5. Pattern recognition
6. Integration with CoreMemory
7. Query and retrieval optimization
8. Performance optimization

## Success Criteria

- Narrative memory can store and retrieve theme entries and dynamic patterns
- Integration with CoreMemory works seamlessly
- Performance impact is minimal (<10% overhead)
- Narrative summaries provide meaningful context for assistant responses
- Pattern detection identifies real user behavior patterns
