# Conversational Context & UX Improvements To-Do List

## Overview

Implement conversational context and human-like interaction patterns to make the calendar assistant feel like talking to a real human assistant.

## Priority 1: Conversation Memory & Context

### 1.1 Session Context Management

- [ ] **Add conversation history tracking**
  - Store previous commands and responses in session
  - Maintain context across multiple interactions
  - Handle "it" references ("move it to 2pm")
  - Track conversation state and user intent

### 1.2 User Preference Learning

- [ ] **Implement preference tracking**
  - Learn user's scheduling patterns (usual meeting durations, preferred times)
  - Store user's communication style (formal vs casual)
  - Remember frequently used commands and shortcuts
  - Adapt responses based on learned preferences

### 1.3 Contextual Suggestions

- [ ] **Add smart suggestions**
  - "You usually have team standup on Mondays at 10am, should I schedule that?"
  - "I notice you have a gap at 3pm, would you like me to schedule that project review?"
  - Proactive suggestions based on calendar patterns
  - Context-aware recommendations

## Priority 2: Human-Like Interaction

### 2.1 Adaptive Response Styles

- [ ] **Implement response style matching**
  - Detect user's communication style (formal/casual)
  - Match response tone to user's style
  - Handle emotional cues ("I'm swamped today")
  - Provide empathetic responses

### 2.2 Proactive Assistance

- [ ] **Add proactive features**
  - Detect scheduling conflicts and suggest alternatives
  - Identify back-to-back meetings and suggest buffer time
  - Notice patterns and offer optimization suggestions
  - Alert users to potential issues before they become problems

### 2.3 Natural Language Enhancement

- [ ] **Improve natural language handling**
  - Handle conversational phrases ("I'm busy", "I'm free")
  - Process emotional states and stress levels
  - Provide supportive responses to overwhelmed users
  - Offer help with prioritization and time management

## Priority 3: Workflow Adaptation

### 3.1 Pattern Recognition

- [ ] **Implement learning algorithms**
  - Learn user's work patterns and preferences
  - Adapt to different scheduling styles (detailed vs quick)
  - Remember user's typical meeting types and durations
  - Suggest optimizations based on learned patterns

### 3.2 Multi-step Conversation Handling

- [ ] **Add conversation flow management**
  - Handle complex multi-step requests
  - Maintain context across interruptions
  - Resume previous tasks seamlessly
  - Guide users through complex scheduling scenarios

### 3.3 Context Switching

- [ ] **Implement context preservation**
  - Remember what user was working on
  - Handle interruptions gracefully
  - Return to previous tasks when appropriate
  - Maintain conversation continuity

## Priority 4: Intelligent Assistance

### 4.1 Conflict Resolution

- [ ] **Add smart conflict handling**
  - Detect scheduling conflicts automatically
  - Suggest alternative times or dates
  - Ask user preferences for conflict resolution
  - Provide multiple options for rescheduling

### 4.2 Smart Defaults

- [ ] **Implement intelligent defaults**
  - Suggest meeting durations based on type
  - Recommend times based on user's patterns
  - Auto-fill common meeting details
  - Learn and adapt defaults over time

### 4.3 Proactive Management

- [ ] **Add proactive features**
  - Warn about over-scheduling
  - Suggest breaks between meetings
  - Identify optimal scheduling patterns
  - Offer time management advice

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Core Context Management

1. **Add conversation state tracking**

   - Create `ConversationState` class
   - Store previous commands and responses
   - Implement context retrieval methods
   - Add session persistence

2. **Implement reference resolution**

   - Handle "it", "that", "this" references
   - Track current context and previous actions
   - Add ambiguity detection and clarification
   - Test with various reference scenarios

3. **Add user preference learning**
   - Create `UserPreferences` class
   - Track scheduling patterns and preferences
   - Implement preference-based suggestions
   - Add preference persistence

### Step 2: Enhanced LLM Integration

1. **Update system prompts**

   - Add conversation context to prompts
   - Include user preferences in prompts
   - Add emotional intelligence handling
   - Implement adaptive response styles

2. **Add new LLM functions**

   - `suggest_optimization`: Proactive suggestions
   - `handle_conflict`: Conflict resolution
   - `provide_support`: Emotional support responses
   - `learn_preference`: Update user preferences

3. **Implement context-aware responses**
   - Pass conversation history to LLM
   - Include user preferences in context
   - Add emotional state detection
   - Implement adaptive response generation

### Step 3: Testing & Validation

1. **Create comprehensive test suite**

   - Test conversation memory and context
   - Validate preference learning
   - Test conflict resolution scenarios
   - Verify proactive assistance features

2. **User experience testing**

   - Test natural conversation flows
   - Validate emotional intelligence
   - Verify adaptive response styles
   - Test multi-step conversation handling

3. **Performance optimization**
   - Optimize context retrieval
   - Improve response generation speed
   - Add caching for frequently used data
   - Implement efficient preference storage

## Success Criteria
