# Continuous Testing Integration Plan

## Overview

As we build new features, we should continuously expand our LLM testing coverage to ensure comprehensive evaluation of the assistant's capabilities and prevent regressions. This plan outlines how to integrate testing into our feature development workflow.

## Integration Strategy

### **Feature Development Testing Workflow**

#### 1. **Feature Planning Phase**

- Identify new capabilities and user workflows
- Design test scenarios that exercise new features
- Create personas that would benefit from new functionality
- Define success criteria and evaluation metrics
- Plan integration points with existing features

#### 2. **Development Phase**

- Implement feature with test-driven approach
- Add new test scenarios to `llm_testing/scenarios.py`
- Create personas that test feature boundaries
- Update scoring rubrics for new capabilities
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing features

#### 3. **Integration Phase**

- Test new features with existing personas
- Verify backward compatibility
- Ensure no regressions in existing functionality
- Validate performance impact
- Run comprehensive test suite

#### 4. **Monitoring Phase**

- Track performance of new features over time
- Generate insights for feature refinement
- Create automated issues for problematic areas
- Update test scenarios based on real usage
- Monitor for performance regressions

## Integration Points for New Features

### **Core Memory & Narrative Memory**

- Test how well the assistant leverages historical context
- Evaluate pattern recognition and theme identification
- Assess memory retrieval accuracy and relevance
- Test memory-based personalization capabilities
- Verify context preservation across sessions

### **Conversation Management**

- Multi-turn conversation handling
- Context preservation across turns
- Reference resolution ("move it", "that meeting")
- Conversation state management
- Context switching and recovery

### **EventKit Integration**

- Real calendar operation testing
- Event creation, modification, deletion
- Recurring event handling
- Calendar conflict resolution
- Timezone handling
- Calendar sharing and permissions

### **Edge Case Handling**

- Input normalization and validation
- Error recovery and graceful degradation
- Ambiguous request clarification
- Invalid input handling
- Network failure recovery

### **Accessibility Features**

- Screen reader compatibility
- Keyboard navigation support
- Voice command processing
- Alternative input methods
- Cognitive accessibility support

## Example: Adding Calendar Sharing Feature

### **New Test Scenarios**

- "Share calendar with team member"
- "Collaborative scheduling with external users"
- "Permission management and access control"
- "Cross-platform calendar synchronization"
- "Calendar access revocation"

### **New Personas**

- **Team Lead**: Manages team calendar access
- **External Collaborator**: Needs limited calendar access
- **Administrator**: Manages calendar permissions
- **Security Officer**: Ensures proper access controls

### **New Evaluation Criteria**

- Permission handling accuracy
- Security awareness and compliance
- Collaboration facilitation
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Privacy protection

### **Integration Tests**

- Test with existing personas using new features
- Verify no regressions in basic calendar operations
- Ensure performance impact is minimal
- Validate error handling for permission issues

## Automated Integration

### **PR Testing**

- Run relevant test scenarios on every PR
- Automated issue creation for failing tests
- Performance regression detection
- Coverage analysis for new features

### **Feature Flags**

- Test new features before full deployment
- A/B testing of different implementations
- Gradual rollout with monitoring
- Rollback capabilities for issues

### **Continuous Monitoring**

- Real-time performance tracking
- Automated alerting for regressions
- Trend analysis for new features
- User feedback integration
